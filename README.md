# Softuniada-2024

My solutions for the tasks from Softuniada 2024 - competitive programming. They are done just as an exercise and not as a part of the actual contest. The tasks can be found here: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/4685

Each task is a console application and is in a separate project.

Here are solutions for the following tasks:
1. Peak Element
2. Champions Cup
3. Largest Number
4. Chess
6. Palindromic Number
7. Special Numbers
